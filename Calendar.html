	<p>This table shows the rating of the atmosphere as for the excellent days it will not rain, for good days there is a sign of rain though the probablity is too low, for avarage days is more likely to rain and poor days shows a clear sign of rain and this is so dangerous while in the lake because the waves are so huge which may course alot of accidents.

	<h2><b>Fish Migration</b></h2> 
	January-March
	<br>At this time period, the fish moves to the deaper side if the lake away from the show since there is no fresh water joing the lake that comes with fresh food. Some species like the Nile pearch and Tilapia are mostly found past Ringiti island, past Remba and somehow around Migingo island. At this time period Mfangano, Rusinga and area towards Kisumu area produce good quantity of 'Omena' and 'Fulu'. The omena specie is mostly cought at a high quantity during the dark periods when the moon is not shining.
	<br>
	March-May
	<br>
	During this time period fish migrate from the inner side of the lake to the show because of the fresh water that is increased by the rainy season. At this time most of the fish species are found next to the fish shows except Nile perch and Tilapia though they move abit closer.
	<br>
	June-September
	<br>
	At this time Fish catch is less since the mostly had a great catch during the march- may period so the remaining are moslty fingerlets of small sizes which are recomended to be fished. At this time the fishermen are urged to take a break for a month and allow the fingerlets grow to a recomended size.
	<br>
	October-December
	<br>
	At this time slot the fihsermen are free toget back for fishing and they should go deeper due to less rain in the lake region, therefore some species of fish go deeper in fetch of food and some small species like remain around the show. 
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Here is the map that shows the actual portion off lake victoria owned by Kenya, the fishermen and those who frequently use the alke should observe this keenly to help prevent chaos and frequent fights betwen them and the fishermen from the neighbouring counties that is Ugand and Tanzania 
	<br>We advice our fishermen to minimize crosing the border to go fishing on other side of the border line as this will bring alot of chaos between them and the authorities from Uganda and Tanzania, the border line is drawn immidiately after Ringiti island which falls in the side of our county kenya.</p>
