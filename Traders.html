<p>This week in the month of October , 2020, the Cabinet secretary for Treasury signed a new regulation allowing KRA to install a tax register system in the Traders’ sales system. This system is to be installed to monitor every sale that traders are making and remit this report in real time to the KRA. There has been reports of tax cheats, false representation of facts and data manipulation that has put KRA on the receiving end due to the missed targets.
This consistent loss on revenue has been consistent over the years putting Treasury to put more pressure on KRA. This is what makes the Tax man to review its netting strategies and widen the tax brackets. The Tax man has therefore vowed to collaborate with NTSA, Kenya Power and National Construction Authority to get information of tax payers that are doing business.
However, even though the measures and steps being taken are appropriate and will net as many tax cheats as possible but it shall only promote more of tax evasion than compliance. It may sound controversial but that is the fact. The KRA is more focused on looking for tax cheats but they forget that for every statutory remittance to be successful, there has to be a motivation behind that duty. I remember while working with Copyright Body for music, by embarking on positive stimulation of the users, the return was much better than when we opted for enforcement. This is how the law is going to enhance the tax cheats</p>

   <p>First, the businesses will be willing to invest in two point of sale systems that can be used alternatively to evade submitting the true records. That is when KRA will realize that all over a sudden there is a fall in sales to most businesses. The method is more of a negative stimulation. It shall only bring negative results.
Secondly, most businesses are resorting to colluding with the customers in order to evade the tax in which the customer pays less and the seller doesn’t become liable to register the sale. This scrupulous business method shall become an option due to the strict measures that KRA is undertaking.
KRA is not only having more measures being put in place, but they have failed to advise the treasury on making taxation affordable and friendly. The country Kenya is introducing all manner of tax and rates that makes a business man become frustrated due to the licenses. These licenses and taxes make business people to look for alternative routes to allow them do business without going through the legal system. In fact I heard someone say, that in Kenya, if you were to pay all the taxes and licenses, then you can never do business. If this is a statement to go by, then majority of the business people are evading the tax system no wonder KRA is trying to come up with more measures.</p>

   <p>In conclusion, KRA should be enlightened, that ensuring, a friendly tax system is a priority. For them to succeed in this area, they have to embark of a friendly and positive stimulation schedule. They need to lower the taxes, consolidate certain taxes, mitigate on their approach to defaulters and exercise understanding. Freezing accounts and obtaining weired orders such as running down your partners’ account in the name of getting is what is ought to have been paid is not the best option to deal with tax payers.<br>
